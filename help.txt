# This program has three data structures to represent the player, enemy squirrels, and grass background objects. The data structures are dictionaries with the following keys:

# Keys used by all three data structures:
#     'x' - the left edge coordinate of the object in the game world (not a pixel coordinate on the screen)
#     'y' - the top edge coordinate of the object in the game world (not a pixel coordinate on the screen)
#     'rect' - the pygame.Rect object representing where on the screen the object is located.
# Player data structure keys:
#     'surface' - the pygame.Surface object that stores the image of the squirrel which will be drawn to the screen.
#     'facing' - either set to LEFT or RIGHT, stores which direction the player is facing.
#     'size' - the width and height of the player in pixels. (The width & height are always the same.)
#     'bounce' - represents at what point in a bounce the player is in. 0 means standing (no bounce), up to BOUNCERATE (the completion of the bounce)
#     'health' - an integer showing how many more times the player can be hit by a larger squirrel before dying.
# Enemy Squirrel data structure keys:
#     'surface' - the pygame.Surface object that stores the image of the squirrel which will be drawn to the screen.
#     'movex' - how many pixels per frame the squirrel moves horizontally. A negative integer is moving to the left, a positive to the right.
#     'movey' - how many pixels per frame the squirrel moves vertically. A negative integer is moving up, a positive moving down.
#     'width' - the width of the squirrel's image, in pixels
#     'height' - the height of the squirrel's image, in pixels
#     'bounce' - represents at what point in a bounce the player is in. 0 means standing (no bounce), up to BOUNCERATE (the completion of the bounce)
#     'bouncerate' - how quickly the squirrel bounces. A lower number means a quicker bounce.
#     'bounceheight' - how high (in pixels) the squirrel bounces
# Grass data structure keys:
#     'grassImage' - an integer that refers to the index of the pygame.Surface object in GRASSIMAGES used for this grass object
